## Introduction

Using virtual reality scenarios to treat phobias and other
psychological disorders is getting more frequent. The project goal is to
model from scratch a 3D virtual scene that could have been used with the purpose of
treating these phobias.

The virtual setting portrayed in this work is an urban setting inspired by Lisbon's `Terreiro do Paço` or `Praça do Comércio`.
To portray this 3D scenario, `Blender` was used as the main tool.

To perform the modeling, Google Earth was used to verify the actual measurements of monuments and buildings.

### Introduction

The use of virtual reality scenarios for the treatment of phobias and other 
psychological disorders is increasingly common. The goal of this paper is to
model from scratch a 3D virtual scenario that could have been used for the
treatment of these phobias.

The virtual scenario depicted in this work is an urban scenario inspired by the Praça Do Comércio of the city of Lisbon. To portray this scenario we used the "Blender" tool.

To make the modeling of the Praça do Comércio we based on the model of the Praça do Comércio from Google Earth. And from it we created a plan with the real measures.

The work is divided into two parts:
- Modeling of the desired scenario;
- Animation with images captured with two cameras, one with the aerial view of the scenery and another that simulates the point of view of someone taking a a walk in the square.
