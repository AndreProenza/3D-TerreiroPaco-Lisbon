## Introduction

Using virtual reality scenarios to treat phobias and other
psychological disorders is getting more frequent. The project goal is to
model from scratch a 3D virtual scene that could have been used with the purpose of
treating these phobias.

The virtual setting portrayed in this work is an urban setting inspired by Lisbon's `Terreiro do Paço` or `Praça do Comércio`.
To portray this 3D scenario, `Blender` was used as the main tool.

To perform the modeling, Google Earth was used to verify the actual measurements of monuments and buildings.
